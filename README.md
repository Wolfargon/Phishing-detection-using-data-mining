Here, we have implemented detection of phishing websites using Data Mining approach.

We have built a cloud-based model using a training dataset and Random Forest classifier. The model is deployed on the cloud.

We have built a chrome Extension that takes the URL from the web browser and extracts various URL features, which are then sent to the cloud for testing. Algorithmia cloud is used by us for this purpose.

The model then predicts whether the website visited by the user is safe or phishing.

If the website is predicted as Phishing, an alert will be generated by the chrome extension.

The dataset, code for chrome-extension and all other required resources are provided in this repository.
